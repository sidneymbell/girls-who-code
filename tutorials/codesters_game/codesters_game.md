# Making a game using [`codesters`](https://www.codesters.com/)
SKH 1/4/2018

## Introduction

My brother and I went through the process of creating a game using
[`codesters`](https://www.codesters.com/) during a snow day over break.

To plan the game, we

1. Defined a project goal
2. Made a wireframe
3. Made a coarse-grain to-do list
4. Made a fine-grain to-do list
5. Made a "Beyond 'Minimum Viable Product'" list

## Define a project goal

First, we came up with the concept for our game:

Then, we talked about the game a little bit more and made the concept more specific:

This statement became our "Minimum Viable Product" (MVP).

## Wireframe

After we had a concept for the game, we made a wireframe:

We showed how we thought the game would start, what would happen if the user did the right thing (dodge the asteroid), and what would happen if the user did the wrong thing (fail to dodge the asteroid).

## Coarse-grain to-do list

The next thing we did was make a rough outline of the steps we need to complete in order to make the game. These steps might seem obvious but actually helped us with the planning.

For instance, first we thought we would write the instructions and then make the game. But we realized we should make the game first because we might make changes to our plan while we were coding which would affect the instructions.

## Fine-grain to-do list

Next, we took two of the items on the course-grain to-do list and made fine-grain to-do lists. These lists had very specific actions or questions. This helped us break down the project into manageable pieces and decide what we would do first.

We looked through the "Sprites" and "Stage" on [`codesters`](https://www.codesters.com/) to complete the action-items under "Design".

We looked under "events", "physics", and "actions" on [`codesters`](https://www.codesters.com/) and talked about how we wanted the game to go to complete the action-items under "Code".

## Beyond MVP brainstorm

During this process we came up with lot's of different ideas but many of them went beyond our "Minimum Viable Project" (MVP). We put them on a separate list. After we make the basic game we might go back and implement some of these ideas.
